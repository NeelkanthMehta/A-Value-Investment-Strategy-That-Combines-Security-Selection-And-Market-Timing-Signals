# An Value Investment Strategy That Combines Security Selection And Market Timing Signals
This is a repo of our algorithms and researches conducted for our research.

There are three algorithms submitted as part of our research.

The algos only run on Quantopian IDE. Copy and paste an algorithm in the Quantopian algorithm IDE, select start, end date for the backtest and initial dollar amount options in the IDE and run the backtest. We backtested all our strategies with nominal amount of USD 10K.

The accompalishing iPython notebook contains tearsheets of various backtests and will only execute in Quantopian environment. You need to to upload the notebook in Quantopian/ Research/ Notebooks page to be able to execute code.

Desclaimer: This code was designed with Quantopian 2 guidelines in mind. Quantopian environment periodically evolves, which means at some time in future bugs might develop into the code.
