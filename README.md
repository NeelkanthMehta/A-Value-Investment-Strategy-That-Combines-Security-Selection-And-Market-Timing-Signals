# WQU-MScFE_690_-_CapStone_Project
This is a repo of our algorithms and researches conducted for Capstone project at WorldQuant University MSc finance Engineering program

There are three algorithms that shall be/ have been submitted (depending on when you are reading this) as part of our capstone project, as well as on Quantopian platform.

The algos are just for display purposes as they're compiled in Quantopian IDE and can only run on Quantopian platform. So copy and past an algorithm in the Quantopian algorithm IDE, select start and end date for the backtest and initial dollar amount options in the IDE and run the backtest.

The accompalishing iPython notebook contains tearsheets of various backtests and will only execute in Quantopian environment. One requires to upload the notebook in hist Quantopian/ Research/ Notebooks page to be able to execute code.

Desclaimer: This code was designed with Quantopian 2 guidelines in mind. Quantopian environment periodically evolves, which means at some time in future bugs might develop into the code. In that case either, WQU MScFE 690 moderators are requested to get back back to us specifying the error message and line number that error occured. We shall fix the error in reasonable time.
