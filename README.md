# WQU-MScFE_690_-_CapStone_Project
This is a repo of our algorithms and researches conducted for Capstone project at WorldQuant University MSc finance Engineering program

There are three algorithms that shall be/ have been submitted (depending on when you are reading this) as part of our capstone project, as well as on Quantopian platform.

The algos are just for display purposes as they're compiled in Quantopian IDE and can only run on Quantopian platform. So copy and past an algorithm in the Quantopian algorithm IDE, select start and end date for the backtest and initial dollar amount options in the IDE and run the backtest.
